## Specification

Complete the following exercises, saving your solutions in the indicated files. 

1. With your group, review the [Linux/Bash Slides](https://slides.com/profdressel/linux-bash-overview) together and discuss. Be sure to actually do the suggested tasks, using a Terminal within CoCalc.
1. Using nano (or vim - see the [vim Overview Slides](https://slides.com/profdressel/vim-overview)) in a terminal for practice, write a bash program ```helloworld.sh``` that simply prints "Hello world." (with a new line at the end) to the screen, and properly exits with the success code of 0. Make sure the top line of the program is the line ```#!/bin/bash``` that tells linux to run the bash interpreter, and make sure you change the permissions of the script to be executable with ```chmod```. Verify that you can run the program from the same directory in a terminal with: ```./helloworld.sh```. Commit the script to this GitHub repository using the web interface "Upload files" button.
1. Using nano or vim in a terminal, write a bash program ```createfiles.sh``` that creates a directory ```tmpfiles``` in the working directory, then creates 100 files named ```file001.tmp``` to ```file100.tmp``` in that directory. After the files are created, append the line ```Temporary file XXX``` to each one, where "XXX" is the number in the filename. Make the script executable as in the previous exercise and verify that you can run the program from the same directory with: ```./createfiles.sh```. Commit the script to this GitHub repository using the web interface.
